    """
    A cluster-analysis of the current `World`'s organisms.

    The clustering algorithm used is "mean shift" which automatically determines the number of clusters
    and can use the previous clusters as the initial `seeds` to search for the next set of clusters.

    The `BANDWIDTH` constant is used to determine how large of a space to consider for a cluster.
    If there are too many clusters, increase the bandwidth and vice-versa.
    This parameter is sensitive to the number of traits and the gene size.

    `self.seeds` is a list of the centers of the current clusters, where the `i`th seed .
    `self.labels` is a list of integers where the `i`th organism belongs to the cluster `self.labels[i]` centered at `self.seeds[i]`.
    `self.labels_colors` is a dictionary from `self.labels` to that cluster's color.
